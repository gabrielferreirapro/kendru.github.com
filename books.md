## Learn ClojureScript

A few years ago, I started writing a book on ClojureScript that was geared towards JavaScript
programmers. At the time, the best resources for learning ClojureScript were aimed at existing
Clojure programmers who wanted to leverage their skills to build web applications. I saw
ClojureScript as being a good answer to the constant flux that was happening in the JavaScript
community, with new frameworks and libraries being released faster than anyone could keep up
with. The language itself was also undergoing some of its most significant changes, and I saw
in ClojureScript a stable, well-designed alternative to JavaScript.

While the JavaScript ecosystem has matured and stabilized, I believe that there is still a place
for languages like ClojureScript. The focus on a single programming paradigm, a rich standard
library, and an ethos of simplicity are no less important than they were a few years ago. In order
to better represent the state of JavaScript today, I have tried to update the JavaScript code
snippets in these posts and rewrite some of the sections comparing the two languages. I hope that
you enjoy reading these posts and that they can be of some use to new ClojureScript programmers!
