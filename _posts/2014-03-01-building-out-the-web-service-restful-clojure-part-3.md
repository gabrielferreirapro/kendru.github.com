<aside>
Before we get started, I want to give a small disclaimer. At the end of
the last tutorial, I mentioned that we would be dealing with authentication in
this tutorial. However, once I started writing this tutorial, I realized that
it would be _way_ too long to cover authentication. I will cover authentication
in the next tutorial - I promise!

## Passing our tests

If you recall from the 
[last tutorial](/restful-clojure/2014/02/19/getting-a-web-server-up-and-running-with-compojure-restful-clojure-part-2/),
we have a few tests that are currently failing. This is a good thing, because
now we know exactly what we need to do to get the tests passing. For refernece,
here are the tests from last time:

{% highlight clojure %}
(ns restful-clojure.handler-test
  (:use clojure.test
        ring.mock.request
        restful-clojure.handler))

(deftest test-app
  (testing "users endpoint"
    (let [response (app (request :get "/users"))]
      (is (= (:status response) 200))
      (is (= (get-in response [:headers "Content-Type"]) "application-json"))))

  (testing "lists endpoint"
    (let [response (app (request :get "/lists"))]
      (is (= (:status response) 200))
      (is (= (get-in response [:headers "Content-Type"]) "application-json"))))

  (testing "not-found route"
    (let [response (app (request :get "/bogus-route"))]
      (is (= (:status response) 404)))))
{% endhighlight %}

We need to expose `/users` and `/lists` as JSON api endpoints, and we also need
to have our app send an HTTP 404 response for undefined routes. Since the last
test will be the simplest to pass, let's go ahead and tackle that one first.
Open up `handler.clj` and get rid of the code from the dummy counting routes
that we created before, and replace them instead with a handler that only has
a `not-found` route:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defroutes app-routes
  (route/not-found "{\"message\":\"Page not found\"}"))

(def app app-routes)
{% endhighlight %}

If you're like me, you might be wondering how the not-found route works. Well,
since we're dealing with a clojure library, we're in luck! Go ahead and start
up a repl (`lein repl` from the `restful_clojure` directory), and we can delve
into the code:

{% highlight clojure %}
(doc compojure.route/not-found)
; => ([body])
; =>   A route that returns a 404 not found response, with its argument as the
; =>   response body.
; => nil
(source compojure.route/not-found)
; => (defn not-found
; =>   "A route that returns a 404 not found response, with its argument as the
; =>   response body."
; =>   [body]
; =>   (wrap-head
; =>     (fn [request]
; =>       (-> (response/render body request)
; =>           (status 404)))))
; => nil
{% endhighlight %}

Expecting more? Sorry to disappoint! That is the beauty of lisp - that
something like handling 404s can be handled with a 4 line function.

If you run the tests again, you'll notice that the last one is passing!
However, we're creating a JSON string directly in our code - yuck! Before we
move on to implementing the `/users` and `/lists` endpoints, let's introduce
some middleware that will create JSON response bodies from Clojure data
structures.

<aside>
You might notice that we are defining the `app` var to the same Ring handler as
`app-routes`. While the function generated by Compojure's `defroutes` macro is
a valid Ring handler, our application is going to consist of a set of routes
wrapped in middleware. Since we know that we will immediately be adding
some middleware to our app, it makes sense to go ahead and separate our
application handler from the routes.
</aside>

## Wiring custom Ring middleware

In most applications, there are certain concerns (e.g. logging, authentication,
content nedotiation, etc.) that we want to take care of at a high level. In
some frameworks, these concerns are taken care of by a 
[Front Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Controller_pattern) or
plugin. With Ring, however, we can simply wrap our routes in another handler
that does... well, pretty much anything we want it to. Can you feel the power?
I can feel the power.

[Middleware](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Concepts#wiki-middleware)
are higher-order functions that take in a handler function and return a handler
function. You can modify the request or the response, or you can perform some
side-effect like logging the request to a file. Let's extend our application by
adding some _extremely basic_ logging - we'll log the request map to the
server's console:

{% highlight clojure %}
; handler.clj
; ...

; Behold, our middleware! Note that it's common to prefix our middleware name
; with "wrap-", since it surrounds any routes an other middleware "inside"
(defn wrap-log-request [handler]
  (fn [req] ; return handler function
    (println req) ; perform logging
    (handler req))) ; pass the request through to the inner handler

; We can attach our middleware directly to the main application handler. All
; requests/responses will be "fitered" through our logging handler.
(def app
  (-> app-routes
    wrap-log-request))
{% endhighlight %}

If you fire up the server with `lein ring server-headless`  (or just `server`
if you're testing it out locally). And hit it with any URL, you should see your
request map printed out to the console. This can be helpful for debugging in
development but is probably not something that we want in production.

As you can see, writing middleware is not terribly complicated. That doesn't
mean, however, that we _should_ re-invent the wheel just because we _can_. For
our application, we want to convert Clojure data structures to JSON responses
(and we probably want to parse JSON request bodies as well). For this we can
use [ring-json](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-json) from James Reeves
(the maintainer of Ring and a number of other projects). Let's add it to our
`project.clj` as a dependency:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defproject restful-clojure "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
; ...
:dependencies [
; ... other dependencies ...
		[ring/ring-json "0.2.0"]])
{% endhighlight %}

Now over in `handler.clj`, we can add the middleware provided by `ring-json`.
Here's what the entire file should look like at this point:

{% highlight clojure %}
(ns restful-clojure.handler
  (:use compojure.core
        ring.middleware.json)
  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]
            [ring.util.response :refer [response]]
            [compojure.route :as route]))

; Notice that the body of out not-found route is now a Clojure map.
; The wrap-json-response middleware will take care of converting this to a
; JSON string.
(defroutes app-routes
  (route/not-found 
    (response {:message "Page not found"})))

(defn wrap-log-request [handler]
  (fn [req]
    (println req)
    (handler req)))

(def app
  (-> app-routes
    wrap-log-request
    wrap-json-response
    wrap-json-body))
{% endhighlight %}

With this middleware in place, we are all set to parse JSON request bodies and
serve up JSON responses. Now we are finally ready to implement the core of our
application, starting with the tests.

## Persisting to a database

In order to persist our data to a database, we'll add the JDBC driver for
PostgreSQL, the [Korma](http://sqlkorma.com) library (which provides a nice
DSL for querying SQL databases), and
[Ragtime](https://github.com/weavejester/ragtime) for database migrations.
Let's add the dependencies to `project.clj`. I'll go ahead and display the
entire source of the file since we're adding code in a few places:

{% highlight clojure %}
(defproject restful-clojure "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "An example RESTful shopping list application back-end written
in Clojure to accompany a tutorial series on kendru.github.io"
  :url "https://github.com/kendru/restful-clojure"
  :license {:name "MIT"
            :url "http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [ring/ring-core "1.2.1"]
                 [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.2.1"]
                 [compojure "1.1.6"]
                 [cheshire "5.3.1"]
                 [ring/ring-json "0.2.0"]
                 [korma "0.3.0-RC5"]
                 [org.postgresql/postgresql "9.2-1002-jdbc4"]
                 [ragtime "0.3.4"]]

  :plugins [[lein-ring "0.8.10"]
            [ragtime/ragtime.lein "0.3.6"]]

  :ring {:handler restful-clojure.handler/app
         :nrepl {:start? true
                 :port 9998}}

  ; Have ragtime default to loading the database URL from an environment
  ; variable so that we don't keep production credentials in our
  ; source code. Note that for our dev environment, we set this variable
  ; with Puppet (see default.pp).
  :ragtime {:migrations ragtime.sql.files/migrations
            :database (System/getenv "DB_URL")}

  :profiles
  {:dev {:dependencies [[javax.servlet/servlet-api "2.5"]
                        [ring-mock "0.1.5"]]}
   :test {:ragtime {:database
"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/restful_test?user=restful_test&password=pass_test"}}})
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can create the directory to hold our migrations and create our initial
migrations.

{% highlight bash %}
$ pwd
# /home/andrew/restful-clojure/restful-clojure
$ mkdir migrations
$ touch migrations/$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S")-add-initial-tables.up.sql
$ touch migrations/$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S")-add-initial-tables.down.sql
{% endhighlight %}

The migrations are in
[the project repo](https://github.com/kendru/restful-clojure), but we won't go
into them in detail here. Basically, they create tables for `users`, `lists`,
`products`, and `product_lists` (and a couple other things). If you're
following along with the project, you can just copy the files from the repo.

And with that, we should be able to run the initial migration from our VM to
create the users table:

{% highlight bash %}
$ lein ragtime migrate
# Applying 2014-03-03-213517-add-initial-tables
{% endhighlight %}

And let's go ahead and migrate the test database as well:

{% highlight bash %}
$ lein with-profile test ragtime migrate
# Applying 2014-03-03-213517-add-initial-tables
{% endhighlight %}

This will use the comfiguration specified under the `:test` profile specified
in project.clj for migrating the database. We're set up. We're migrated. We're
ready to code.

## Getting to the good stuff

Let's begin by writing the tests for our CRUD operations on both users and
lists:

{% highlight clojure %}
; tests/restful_clojure/users_test.clj
(ns restful-clojure.users-test
  (:use clojure.test
        restful-clojure.test-core)
  (:require [restful-clojure.models.users :as users]
            [environ.core :refer [env]]))

; Run each test in an isolated db transaction and rollback
; afterwards
(use-fixtures :each with-rollback)

(deftest create-read-users
  (testing "Create user"
    (let [count-orig (users/count-users)]
      (users/create {:name "Charlie" :email "charlie@example.com"})
      (is (= (inc count-orig) (users/count-users)))))
  
  (testing "Retrieve user"
    (let [user (users/create {:name "Andrew" :email "me@mytest.com"})
          found-user (users/find-by-id (user :id))]
      (is (= "Andrew" (found-user :name))
      (is (= "me@mytest.com" (found-user :email))))))

  (testing "Find by email"
    (users/create {:name "John Doe" :email "j.doe@ihearttractors.com"})
    (let [user (users/find-by-email "j.doe@ihearttractors.com")]
      (is (= "John Doe" (user :name))))))

(deftest multiple-user-operations
  (testing "Find all users"
    (doseq [i (range 10)]
      (users/create {:name "Test user"
                     :email (str "user." i "@example.com")}))
    (is (= 10 (count (users/find-all))))))

(deftest update-users
  (testing "Modifies existing user"
    (let [user-orig (users/create {:name "Curious George" :email
"i.go.bananas@hotmail.com"})
          user-id (user-orig :id)]
      (users/update-user (assoc user-orig :name "Chiquita Banana"))
      (is (= "Chiquita Banana" (:name (users/find-by-id user-id)))))))

(deftest delete-users
  (testing "Decreases user count"
    (let [user (users/create {:name "Temporary" :email
"ephemerial@shortlived.org"})
          user-count (users/count-users)]
      (users/delete-user user)
      (is (= (dec user-count) (users/count-users)))))
  
  (testing "Deleted correct user"
    (let [user-keep (users/create {:name "Keep" :email "important@users.net"})
          user-del (users/create {:name "Delete" :email
"irrelevant@users.net"})]
      (users/delete-user user-del)
      (is (= user-keep
             (users/find-by-id (user-keep :id))))
      (is (= nil
             (users/find-by-id (user-del :id)))))))
{% endhighlight %}

The basic tests for lists are pretty similar, so I won't post them here, but they are
in the tutorial repository. I have also included a `users+lists_test.clj` for
testing the operations that affect both models. Later in this tutorial we will
take a look at the tests and implementation code for dealing with managing the
items on a list.

Now the implementation for both users and lists is fairly straightforward. We're
using Korma to simplify database transactions. We can put all of the
boilerplace Korma code that we will use to define the entities in our system in
a `restful-clojure.entities` namespace. The models themselves will go in
separate namespaces under `restful-clojure.models`.

{% highlight clojure %}
; src/restful_clojure/entities.clj
(ns restful-clojure.entities
  (:use korma.core
        restful-clojure.db))

(declare users lists)

(defentity users
  (pk :id)
  (table :users)
  (has-many lists)
  (entity-fields :name :email))

(defentity lists
  (pk :id)
  (table :lists)
  (belongs-to users {:fk :user_id})
  (entity-fields :title))
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight clojure %}
; src/restful_clojure/models/users.clj
(ns restful-clojure.models.users
  (:use korma.core)
  (:require [restful-clojure.entities :as e]))

(defn find-all []
  (select e/users))

(defn find-by [field value]
  (first
    (select e/users
      (where {field value})
      (limit 1))))

(defn find-by-id [id]
  (find-by :id id))

(defn for-list [listdata]
  (find-by-id (listdata :user_id)))

(defn find-by-email [email]
  (find-by :email email))

(defn create [user]
  (insert e/users
    (values user)))

(defn update-user [user]
  (update e/users
    (set-fields (dissoc user :id))
    (where {:id (user :id)})))

(defn count-users []
  (let [agg (select e/users
              (aggregate (count :*) :cnt))]
    (get-in agg [0 :cnt] 0)))

(defn delete-user [user]
  (delete e/users
    (where {:id (user :id)})))
{% endhighlight %}

Again, since the boilerplate code for lists is not too interesting (and it's
very similar to the code for users, I am not posting the entire code here. I'll
only cover what's different and interesting about lists - adding and removing
items.

You know the drill. We start with the tests:

## Coming up next...
