I am a software professional with a passion for simplicity and an interest
in functional programming. I started programming as a kid, only to decide that
a desk job was not the thing for me. However, the lure of building little
empires of bits in a world of silicon was too great, and I have spent most of my
career crafting software.

Most recently, I started working on a book called _Learn ClojureScript_, which is
being published by [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/). Expect updates
on the writing process once the book hits their early access program.
