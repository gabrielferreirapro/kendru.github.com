I am a software professional with a passion for simplicity and an interest
in functional programming. I started programming as a kid, only to decide that
a desk job was not the thing for me. However, the lure of building little
empires of bits in a world of silicon was too great, and I have spent most of my
career crafting software.

I have always had something of an entrepreneurial spirit, from the "floating rock"
stand where I made my first dollar (they really <em>did</em> float) to the
<small>super top-secret, "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you"</small>
project that is currently occupying my free time. I also have a passion for
learning and helping others learn as well<code>&lt;insert cliche pedagogical
comment.&gt;</code> My hope is that others will be find the content here inspiring
and helpful, or at the very least interesting.
